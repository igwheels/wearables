## R Markdown

The purpose of this project is to demonstrate my ability to collect, work with, and clean a data set.

## Steps

    1) Submit a tidy data set.
    
    2) Link a Github repo with my script for performing the analysis.
    
    3) Include a codebook in the repo with README file. (This is the README file.)
